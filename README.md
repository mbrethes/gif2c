# Gif2c

This is a helper program for the [VidMax7219 Arduino LED panel display driver](https://github.com/mbrethes/vidmax7219).

It allows to generate C files containing image data suitable for the library, from GIF or PNG files generated by tools such as GIMP.

The files must use 5 indexed colors. Colors 0 - 3 correspond to 100% - 75% - 50% - 25% lit, and colors afterwards correspond to 0% lit.
